## 4. Pull Request Guidelines

To ensure a smooth process for reviewing and merging your changes, please follow these guidelines:

- **One Feature/Bug per Pull Request**: Each pull request should focus on a single feature or bug. Avoid bundling multiple unrelated changes into a single PR.
- **Descriptive Title and Body**: Clearly describe what your PR does. Include a reference to any relevant issue numbers (e.g., `Fixes #123`).
- **Keep PRs Small**: Small, focused PRs are easier to review and more likely to be merged quickly.
- **Rebase or Merge Conflicts**: If your PR has conflicts, please resolve them using `git rebase` or merge the latest changes from `main`.
- **Check the Build**: Make sure your code passes any automated tests or build checks.

---

## 5. Issue Guidelines

- **Search Before Opening a New Issue**: Before creating a new issue, check the existing issues to avoid duplicates.
- **Provide Context**: When creating a new issue, provide as much detail as possible, including steps to reproduce (for bugs), screenshots (if applicable), and any relevant log/output messages.
- **Help Wanted**: If you're not sure how to fix an issue but want to help, look for issues labeled `help wanted`.

---

## 6. Coding Standards

To ensure consistency and readability, we follow these coding standards:

- **Code Style**: Follow the project‚Äôs existing coding style. This may include using a specific linter or code formatter (e.g., ESLint for JavaScript projects).
- **Comments**: Use comments to explain complex code or describe the purpose of sections that may not be self-explanatory.
- **Descriptive Variables**: Use clear and descriptive variable and function names.
- **Follow SOLID Principles**: Make sure your code follows common software development principles like DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and SOLID.

---

## 7. Testing and Quality

Before submitting your code, ensure it meets the following requirements:

- **Testing**: If you are adding a feature or fixing a bug, write corresponding tests (unit tests, integration tests, etc.).
- **Linting**: Run the linter to check your code for any style issues:
  ```bash
  npm run lint
  ```
- **Manual Testing**: Run the application manually to verify that your changes work as expected.
